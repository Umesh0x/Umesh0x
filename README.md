# Penetration Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my **Penetration Testing Portfolio**! This repository is a collection of my personal and professional work in the field of cybersecurity. It includes detailed penetration testing reports, write-ups, proof-of-concept exploits, scripts, and various tools I have developed or used throughout my career.

I specialize in **web application security**, **network assessments**, and **red teaming**. In this portfolio, you will find real-world examples of my testing methodologies, exploitation techniques, and findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools

I utilize a wide range of tools and skills throughout my penetration testing process. Below are some of the key tools and techniques I use to discover, exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities:

### **Reconnaissance & OSINT**
- **Nmap**: Network discovery and vulnerability scanning.
- **Amass**, **Sublist3r**: Subdomain enumeration and passive reconnaissance.
- **Shodan**, **Censys**: Internet-wide scanning for exposed devices and services.

### **Web Application Security**
- **Burp Suite**: Web application proxy for vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
- **SQLmap**: Automated SQL Injection exploitation.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application scanner and vulnerability testing.
- **Nikto**: Web server scanner for common security issues.

### **Exploitation & Post-Exploitation**
- **Metasploit Framework**: Exploit development and automation.
- **Empire**: PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework.
- **Mimikatz**: Credential dumping from Windows systems.
- **Responder**, **CrackMapExec**: SMB/NetSession enumeration and exploitation.

### **Programming & Scripting**
